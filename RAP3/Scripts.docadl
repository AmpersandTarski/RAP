CONTEXT RAP3 IN ENGLISH

PURPOSE PATTERN "Registration of Ampersand source files"
{+As a student, I need to submit files for Ampersand to compile, so that I can get functional specifications and all other goodies that Ampersand has in store for me.
In order to submit an Ampersand script in RAP3, the user uploads text in the web-application.
This pattern defines what administration RAP3 will do in order before compiling the script/
+}

PURPOSE RELATION submittor[Script*Account]
{+RAP3 keeps separate workspaces for different users.
For that purpose, RAP3 registers the account under which the script has been submitted.
It registers accounts rather than persons to minimize the amount of personal data stored in RAP3.
+}

PURPOSE RELATION assignment[Script*Assignment]
{+In order to keep track of different scripts, the system can keep track of the assignment for which the script is an answer.
Two scripts with the same assignment and submittor will be treated as subsequent versions of the same script.
+}

PURPOSE RELATION content[Script*ScriptContent] 
{+TODO+}

PURPOSE RELATION submitted[Script*DateTime]
{+Submitting a script is done by clicking on a submit-widget in the web-application of RAP3.
When files are already present when the database is initialized, the corresponding script must be made and the file creation date will be the submission date.
+}

PURPOSE INTERFACE StudentScripts
{+This interface gives a tutor an overview of the scripts submitted by students.
+}

PURPOSE RULE "Submission Timestamping"
{+To ensure that the submittor of every script is known, the following rule automatically stamps every script with its submittor and a timestamp.
The account logged in when creating a new script is considered to be the submittor.
+}
