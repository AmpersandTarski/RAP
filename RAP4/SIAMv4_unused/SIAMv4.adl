--[Account initialization]
{- Creating an account (e.g. when importing through an Excel file) does not make it usable immediately.
For example, its property `accIsActive` must be set before it can be used to login with.
The property `accIsInitialized` is defined to help distinguish between Accounts that are, and those that are not initialized.
Note: setting the property `accIsActive` will automatically also set `accIsInitialized`.-}
